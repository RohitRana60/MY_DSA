An `ArrayList` in Java is a dynamic array implementation of the `List` interface. It is part of the Java
 Collections Framework and is found in the `java.util` package. Unlike traditional arrays, `ArrayList` can
 dynamically resize itself, making it more flexible for handling collections of data.

### Key Features of ArrayList:

1. **Dynamic Sizing:**
   - `ArrayList` can dynamically grow or shrink in size, which means you can add or remove elements easily without
    worrying about the size.

2. **Ordered Collection:**
   - `ArrayList` maintains the order of elements as they are inserted. The order is significant and is based on the
   order of insertion.

3. **Random Access:**
   - `ArrayList` provides constant-time access to elements based on their index, allowing for efficient random access.

4. **Backed by an Array:**
   - Internally, an `ArrayList` is backed by an array. When the array reaches its capacity, it is automatically
    resized to accommodate more elements.
