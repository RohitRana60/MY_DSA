Taking user input in Java is a fundamental aspect of interactive programming. The `Scanner` class is commonly used to read input from the user. Here are the steps to take user input in Java:

1. **Import the Scanner Class:**
   - To use the `Scanner` class, you need to import it at the beginning of your Java program.

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

2. **Create a Scanner Object:**
   - After importing, create a `Scanner` object to read input from the user. This typically involves instantiating the `Scanner` class with `System.in` as an argument, indicating input from the keyboard.

   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   ```

3. **Prompt the User:**
   - Print a message to prompt the user for input, so they know what information is expected.

   ```java
   System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
   ```

4. **Read User Input:**
   - Use appropriate methods of the `Scanner` class to read the input. For example, you can use `next()` to read a single word, `nextInt()` to read an integer, `nextLine()` to read a line of text, etc.

   ```java
   String name = scanner.next(); // Read a single word
   ```

   ```java
   int age = scanner.nextInt(); // Read an integer
   ```

   ```java
   String city = scanner.nextLine(); // Read a line of text
   ```

5. **Close the Scanner:**
   - It's a good practice to close the `Scanner` object when you're done with it to release resources.

   ```java
   scanner.close();
   ```

Here's an example combining these steps:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 2: Create a Scanner object
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Step 3: Prompt the user
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");

        // Step 4: Read user input
        String name = scanner.next();

        // Print the entered information
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");

        // Step 5: Close the Scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
